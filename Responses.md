DAY 1: I hope to learn more about AI technology and how to apply this knowledge to help improve the lives of specific demographics of people around me. I hope that through the program, I am able to use my passion for Computer Science for societal good.
DAY 2: I loved Dr. Kong's Leadership Development seminar, especially since it focused on telling our story to find something that we can lead/excel in. It had always been my dream to go to a place where I can just sit down and listen to someone tell me their life story, and through this workshop, I got to hear more about my peers' inspiring stories and connect with them. I am excited to apply Dr. Kong's challenges, choices, and outcomes storytelling framework to tell my own story!
