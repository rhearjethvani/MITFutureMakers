## Day 2: Wednesday, July 7, 2021: Become a Leader!
### Objectives:
1. To develop the skills, mindset, and vision of a leader

### Lesson Plan:
1. Dr. David Kong's Leadership Development Seminar

### Workshops & Key Learnings:
#### Leadership Development Seminar with Dr. David Kong from the MIT Media Lab:
- Rabbi Hillel's 3 Questions: If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am for myself alone, what am I? If not now, when? --> connects to story of self, story of now, and story of us (purpose, urgency, and community)
- Leadership is accepting responsibility for enabling others to achieve shared purpose in the face of uncertainty
- How (strategy analysis aka the head) + Why (story motivation aka the heart) = Mindful Action
- Plot of a story is created through challenge, choice, and outcome, all coinciding with an underlying moral

### Action Item(s):
1. DAY 2 REFLECTION: I loved Dr. Kong's Leadership Development Seminar, especially since it focused on telling our story to find something that we can lead/excel in. Rather than providing us with ways to be a better leader, Dr. Kong's session empowered us to find a reason to push ourselves to be better, which was really inspiring for me. Listening to people's life stories has always interested me, and through this workshop, I got to hear more about my peers' inspiring stories and connect with them. I am excited to apply Dr. Kong's challenges, choices, and outcomes storytelling framework to tell my own story and make a poisitve difference in my community!

## Day 3: Thursday, July 8, 2021: Introduction to Machine Learning and Scikit-Learn
### Objectives:
1. Introduction to some basic Machine Learning (ML) concepts and models
2. Build ML model development skills

### Lesson Plan:
1. Review Machine Learning models and algorithms using ["An Introduction to Machine Learning Theory and Its Applications: A Visual Tutorial with Examples" article](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/machine-learning-theory-an-introductory-primer)
2. Supplemental Activity: [Your First Machine Learning Model Kaggle Activity on Predicting Housing Prices in Iowa](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/your-first-machine-learning-model)

### Workshops & Key Learnings:
#### Deep Learning Overview with Head Mentors
- Hierarchy: Artificial Intelligence (a cognitive ability that enables the computer to think and mimic actions like humans) --> Machine Learning (a technique which uses statistical models to learn and improve automatically from experience) --> Neural Networks (a subset of ML to analyze different factors and patterns using a network similar to human brain) --> Deep Learning (a richer structure of Neural Networks)
- ML can be applied to all fields i.e. finance (identify fraudulent behavior), healthcare (consumption monitoring), search engines (spam filters), etc.
- The elements of ML include dataset (split into training set, validation set, and testing set), algorithm, and prediction
- The steps of the ML algorithm framework include 1. model training and parameter tuning, model validation and evaluation, and iteration to find the best model (all done using the training set and validation set)
- Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning
#### Inclusive Leadership with Salila Yohn
- Diversity: everyone has their unique story
- Equity: the idea that acknowledges that not everyone has equal access to opportunities that will help them succeed
- When you don't feel included express your discomfort clearly and calmly
#### Self-Study Applied Deep Learning Curriculum
- "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance of T, as measured by P, improves with experience E" - Tom Mitchell, Carnegie Mellon University
- Goal of ML: make guesses that are good enough to be useful, not to make "perfect" guesses
- Use neural networks where the number of inputs is large, making the computational cost of handling the problem too overwhelming
- Algorithm types:
  - Regression: fitting linear and non-linear models
  - Clustering: unsupervised classification
  - Decision Trees: tree induction and pruning for both classification and regression tasks
  - Neural Networks: end-to-end training for both classification and regression
  - SVMs: for learning decision boundaries
  - Naive Bayes: direct probabilistic modeling
- Function types: Ensemble Methods, Feature Manipulation, Outlier Detection, and Model Selection and Validation

### Action Item(s):
1. [Scikit-learn Model Development Activity: Iris Decision Tree](https://github.com/rhearjethvani/MITFutureMakers/tree/main/irisDecisionTree)
2. [Predicting Housing Prices in Iowa Kaggle Machine Learning Model Activity](https://github.com/rhearjethvani/MITFutureMakers/tree/main/predictingHousingPricesInIowa)
3. DAY 3 REFLECTION: Today, I got to take a more hands-on approach with Machine Learning models amd code my first algorithm. I) Supervised Machine Learning algorithms are trained on labeled data allowing for extrapolation and are primarily used for classification and regression models, whereas Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms are trained on unlabeled data to find patterns and relationships and are primarily used for clustering. Supervised ML learns from feedback meaning it can be difficult and time-consuming to label datasets, whereas Unsupervised ML learns from patterns (no feedback) and can have inaccuracies/find irrelevant relationships due to biases in the data. II) The statement "Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries" is false because Scikit-Learn is built to model data through supervised and unsupervised machine learning data and requires additional libraries to visualize the data such as Pandas and Graphviz.

2. Explore ["Whatâ€™s the Difference Between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?" article](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/07/29/whats-difference-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-ai/) to learn more about the differences between the subsets of AI
3. A Quick Dive into the Ethics of AI using ["Ethics in Machine Learning" article](https://towardsdatascience.com/ethics-in-machine-learning-9fa5b1aadc12)

### Workshops & Key Learnings:
#### Deep Learning Overview with Head Mentors
- Traditional Images classification (hand-designed feature extraction algorithms) vs Deep Learning classification (stacking layers that automatically learn more intricate, abstract, and discriminating features and at the end work as a classifier)
- Deep Learning is becoming prevalent now because of availability of data, improved algorithms, and improved technology
- Applications of DL include Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Processing:
  - Central Processing Unit (CPU): tens of operations per cycle (1x1 data unit; scalar)
  - Graphical Processing Unit (GPU): tens of thousands of operations per cycle (1xN data unit; vector)
  - Tensor Processing Unit (TPU): 128,000 operations per cycel (NxN data unit; tensor)
#### Reflection Corner
- Reflected on "Week 1: The Basics" Learnings
#### Self-Study Applied Deep Learning Curriculum
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) - represents the structure of a human brain modeled on the computer, consisting of neurons and synapses organized into layers
- Components of Neural Networks:
  - Neuron/Node - basic unit of neural networks that receives information, performs calculations, and passes it further (each one processes input data to extract a feature, has its own weights that are used to weigh the features, and has an activation function)
    - input neurons - receive information from the outside world
    - hidden neurons - process information
    - output neurons - produce a conclusion
  - Input --> Simple Features --> More Abstract Features --> Mapping from Features --> Output
  - Synapse - connects the neurons; each has a weight (which adds change in the input information)
- Bias - allows for more variations of weights to be stored
- Algorithm Training: iteration (counter that increases every time the neural network goes through one training set), epoch (increases each time we go through the entire set of training sets), or batch (equal to the number of training examples in one forward/backward pass)
- Types of Neural Networks:
  - Feed-Forward Neural Networks - no memory + no going back
  - Recurrent Neural Networks - process texts, videos, or sets of images + become more precise every time because it remembers the results of the previous iteration and can use that information to make better decisions
  - Convolutional Neural Networks - can either be Feed-Forward or Recurrent
  - Generative Adversarial Neural Networks - unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms that combines two neural networks (i.e. Network G generates patterns and Network A tries to distinguish genuine samples from the fake ones)
- Neural Network applications: classification, prediction, and recognition
- Ethics in Machine Learning: bias can be present in the data, algorithm, and/or results

### Action Item(s):
1. DAY 4 REFLECTION: I learned about the ethics of Machine Learning and other issues in the field. I also enjoyed learning about how Deep Learning works (i.e. more in-depth knowledge about CPU, GPU, and TPU). A dataset I found is the [2021 State Government Tax Dataset](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2020/econ/stc/2020-annual.html) that can help create models to draw conclusions about the United States economy. By using Machine Learning, we can analyze the effects of the recent American Rescue Plan (including stimulus checks) on the national economy, which is the topic of my current research project.
