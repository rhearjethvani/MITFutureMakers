## Day 1: Tuesday, July 6, 2021: Welcome to SureStart! (Getting Started)
### Objectives:
1. To get comfortable with the following languages, libraries, and spaces: Python, NumPy, and Github
2. To begin building a technical profile on Github

### Lesson Plan:
1. [MIT FutureMakers Create-a-thon Ramp-Up](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f45536caa356e6ab51588f4/t/60c5f9d1311d375de93595e6/1623587288184/MIT+FutureMakers+Ramp+Up.pdf)

### Workshops & Key Learnings:
#### Program Kick-Off:
- [MIT RAISE](raise.mit.edu): a K-12 AI Education initiative @ the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
- With today's information technology, young people have opportunities to create impact on their lives and on their communities --> FutureMakers take Computational Action
- Program Outcome: new tech and "power" skills, a repo of code or app samples, a video of final Create-a-thon Presentation, and more confidence and interest in AI
- Applied Deep Learning Track: learning period from July 6, 2021 to July 30, 2021, and Create-a-thon from August 2, 2021 to August 13, 2021
#### Deep Learning Overview with Head Mentors
- Learned about Python and NumPy in relation to Deep Learning (i.e. list iteration, indexing, broadcasting, etc.
- Jupyter Notebook & Colab Notebook Demos
#### STEM + Computing Reflection Corner for All
- How an interest in computing correlate to different STEM fields and careers
- Not only do the fields utilize logical approaches, they also require creative problem-solving skills and have the power to create something good for our society

### Action Item(s):
1. DAY 1 REFLECTION: I am excited to learn more about AI technology and how to apply this knowledge to help improve the lives of specific demographics of people around me by implementing Deep Learning within my projects. I hope that through the program, I am able to use my passion for Computer Science for societal good.

## Day 2: Wednesday, July 7, 2021: Become a Leader!
### Objectives:
1. To develop the skills, mindset, and vision of a leader

### Lesson Plan:
1. Dr. David Kong's Leadership Development Seminar

### Workshops & Key Learnings:
#### Leadership Development Seminar with Dr. David Kong from the MIT Media Lab:
- Rabbi Hillel's 3 Questions: If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am for myself alone, what am I? If not now, when? --> connects to story of self, story of now, and story of us (purpose, urgency, and community)
- Leadership is accepting responsibility for enabling others to achieve shared purpose in the face of uncertainty
- How (strategy analysis aka the head) + Why (story motivation aka the heart) = Mindful Action
- Plot of a story is created through challenge, choice, and outcome, all coinciding with an underlying moral

### Action Item(s):
1. DAY 2 REFLECTION: I loved Dr. Kong's Leadership Development Seminar, especially since it focused on telling our story to find something that we can lead/excel in. Rather than providing us with ways to be a better leader, Dr. Kong's session empowered us to find a reason to push ourselves to be better, which was really inspiring for me. Listening to people's life stories has always interested me, and through this workshop, I got to hear more about my peers' inspiring stories and connect with them. I am excited to apply Dr. Kong's challenges, choices, and outcomes storytelling framework to tell my own story and make a poisitve difference in my community!

## Day 3: Thursday, July 8, 2021: Introduction to Machine Learning and Scikit-Learn
### Objectives:
1. Introduction to some basic Machine Learning (ML) concepts and models
2. Build ML model development skills

### Lesson Plan:
1. Review Machine Learning models and algorithms with this [article](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/machine-learning-theory-an-introductory-primer)

### Action Item(s):
1. [Scikit-learn Model Development Activity: Iris Decision Tree](https://github.com/rhearjethvani/MITFutureMakers/tree/main/irisDecisionTree)
2. DAY 3 REFLECTION: Today, I got to take a more hands-on approach with Machine Learning models  which was really cool. I) Supervised learning is an approach in which the program is "trained" on a predefined set of "training examples" and the features are pre-defined and extracted. In contrast, unsupervised learning is an approach where the program is given the data and must find patterns and relationships itself, meaning a more hands-off approach. II) The statement "Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries" is false because without utilizing the Graphvis libraries, there was no output for the IrisDecisionTree project.





DAY 4: I liked learning about the ethics of Machine Learning today and understanding the issues of the field. A dataset I found is the 2021 State Government Tax Dataset (https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2020/econ/stc/2020-annual.html). This dataset includes data points that discuss the United States economy.<br>
DAY 7: I enjoyed learning about Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch today. I) Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays with a uniform type such as floats, integers, complex numbers, and strings. Tensors comprise of different shapes (the length of each of the axes of a tensor i.e. scalar: rank-0 tensor, vector: rank-1 tensor, matrix: rank-2 tensor, and cube of matrices: rank-3 tensor), ranks (number of tensor axes), axes/dimensions (a particular dimension of a tensor), and sizes (the total number of items in the tensor, the product shape vector). II) I noticed that the computations in the tutorial are represented in the form of various graphs (i.e. data flow).
