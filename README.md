# MITFutureMakers
SureStart X MIT RAISE<br>

## Day 1: Tuesday, July 6, 2021: Welcome to SureStart! (Getting Started)</br>
### Objectives: </br>
1. To get comfortable with the following languages, libraries, and spaces: Python, NumPy, and Github. </br>
2. To begin building a technical profile on Github

### Lesson Plan: </br>
1. [MIT FutureMakers Create-a-thon Ramp-Up](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f45536caa356e6ab51588f4/t/60c5f9d1311d375de93595e6/1623587288184/MIT+FutureMakers+Ramp+Up.pdf)

### Workshops & Key Learnings: </br>
#### Program Kick-Off:
- [MIT RAISE](raise.mit.edu): a K-12 AI Education initiative @ the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
- With today's information technology, young people have opportunities to create impact on their lives and on their communities --> FutureMakers take Computational Action
- Program Outcome: new tech and "power" skills, a repo of code or app samples, a video of final Create-a-thon Presentation, and more confidence and interest in AI
- Applied Deep Learning Track: learning period from July 6, 2021 to July 30, 2021, and Create-a-thon from August 2, 2021 to August 13, 2021
#### Deep Learning Overview with Head Mentors </br>
- Learned about Python and NumPy in relation to Deep Learning (i.e. list iteration, indexing, broadcasting, etc.
- Jupyter Notebook & Colab Notebook Demos
#### STEM + Computing Reflection Corner for All
- How an interest in computing correlate to different STEM fields and careers
- Not only do the fields utilize logical approaches, they also require creative problem-solving skills and have the power to create something good for our society

### Action Item(s): </br>
1. DAY 1 REFLECTION: I am excited to learn more about AI technology and how to apply this knowledge to help improve the lives of specific demographics of people around me by implementing Deep Learning within my projects. I hope that through the program, I am able to use my passion for Computer Science for societal good.<br>



DAY 2: I loved Dr. Kong's Leadership Development seminar, especially since it focused on telling our story to find something that we can lead/excel in. It had always been my dream to go to a place where I can just sit down and listen to someone tell me their life story, and through this workshop, I got to hear more about my peers' inspiring stories and connect with them. I am excited to apply Dr. Kong's challenges, choices, and outcomes storytelling framework to tell my own story!<br>
DAY 3: Today, I got to take a more hands-on approach with Machine Learning models today which was really cool. I) Supervised learning is an approach in which the program is "trained" on a predefined set of "training examples", whereas unsupervised learning is an approach where the program is given a bunch of data and must find patterns and relationships. This means that the unsupervised method is more hands-off. II) The statement "Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries" is false because without utilizing the Graphvis libraries, there was no output for the IrisDecisionTree project.<br>
DAY 4: I liked learning about the ethics of Machine Learning today and understanding the issues of the field. A dataset I found is the 2021 State Government Tax Dataset (https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2020/econ/stc/2020-annual.html). This dataset includes data points that discuss the United States economy.<br>
DAY 7: I enjoyed learning about Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch today. I) Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays with a uniform type such as floats, integers, complex numbers, and strings. Tensors comprise of different shapes (the length of each of the axes of a tensor i.e. scalar: rank-0 tensor, vector: rank-1 tensor, matrix: rank-2 tensor, and cube of matrices: rank-3 tensor), ranks (number of tensor axes), axes/dimensions (a particular dimension of a tensor), and sizes (the total number of items in the tensor, the product shape vector). II) I noticed that the computations in the tutorial are represented in the form of various graphs (i.e. data flow).
